## Why Panalume?

Panalume is a Home Assistant **app** that gives you a dashboard you design in the browser — no YAML, no grid. It was inspired by [ha-fusion](https://github.com/matt8707/ha-fusion), and goes further on layout freedom, styling and energy data.

- **Free layout** — drag cards anywhere and drag any edge or corner to resize. Cards snap to each other's edges and sizes (with guide lines) and to a grid, and a **magnet** keeps cards joined at your usual gap: make one taller and the cards below move down, drop one into a column and it slots in. Hold Shift for pixel precision.
- **Sidebar** — an optional sidebar that stays put (and keeps its size) while you switch views; cards move freely between sidebar and main area. Turn it off and its cards are kept for later.
- **One layout, every screen** — design once for your wall tablet; desktops show it scaled, phones get an automatic single-column version. Give any device its own custom layout if you want.
- **Made for wall tablets** — *fit the whole view on screen* (no scrolling), a kiosk mode that hides Home Assistant's header bar, and **live updates**: save on your laptop and every tablet updates within a second. After an app update, open screens reload themselves.
- **Templates everywhere** — any text, icon, colour or style can be a live Home Assistant template (`{{ states('sensor.x') }}`), and any card can be shown or hidden by a template.
- **Style anything** — background, colours, radius, border, shadow, glass blur, fonts, custom CSS, per card or for the whole theme, plus a **− / +** to scale everything inside a card.
- **Pop-ups & actions** — tap / hold to toggle, open a detailed pop-up, open a pop-up of other cards, change view, call a service or open a URL.
- **Groups & multi-select** — rooms move as one; select several cards to group, align, size or space them evenly, or show / hide the same part on all of them at once. Copy cards to another view. Undo, duplicate, keyboard nudging.
- **Fast** — a ~75 KB (gzipped) Svelte app that only subscribes to the entities your cards use.

## Energy, front and centre

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/energy.webp" alt="Energy cards" width="900"></p>

First-class cards for UK energy setups, with entities **auto-detected** when you add them:

## Edit in the browser

<p align="center"><img src="docs/screenshots/edit.webp" alt="Editing a card" width="900"></p>

Press the faint pencil (or **E**) to edit. Add cards from the panel, drag and resize them on the canvas, and change content, style, actions and size on the right. Every card's settings form is generated from the card itself, so nothing needs YAML.

### On your phone

Phones get an automatic single-column version of your tablet layout: navigation across the top, rooms kept together, small cards paired two-per-row. Switch phone (or desktop) to a custom layout any time; on the phone, deleting a card closes the gap it leaves.

### All the cards

Button / tile · Light · Thermostat (draggable dial) · Climate group (several thermostats / AC units at once) · Door lock · 3D printer · Hot tub · Washing machine · Tumble dryer · Dishwasher · Media player (artwork, volume, source, speaker grouping) · Cover / blind · Slider · Option picker · Entities list · Glance · Sensor with graph · Gauge · History graph · Weather · Clock · Sun & moon (sunrise / sunset, moon phase, moonrise / moonset) · Text / Markdown · Template lines · People · Camera (tap for full-screen live view) · Web page · Image · Navigation · Divider · Alarm panel · and the energy cards above.

### Coming from ha-fusion?

**Layout → Import from ha-fusion** rebuilds your ha-fusion dashboard — views, rooms, buttons (their templates keep working), cameras and sidebar — and adds an Energy view.

## Install

> **Beta:** Panalume is in beta until 1.0: used every day, but expect changes. Please report problems and ideas in [Issues](https://github.com/leacho73/panalume/issues). Each update has [release notes](https://github.com/leacho73/panalume/releases).

1. In Home Assistant go to **Settings → Apps → App Store → ⋮ → Repositories** and add  
   `https://github.com/leacho73/panalume`
2. Install **Panalume**, start it and turn on **Show in sidebar**.
3. Open **Panalume** from the sidebar and press **E** to start building.

Wall tablet tips: set **Layout → Tablet → Sizing** to *Fit the whole view on screen* and tick *Hide Home Assistant's header bar*. Or add options to the tablet's URL:

| Option | Does |
|---|---|
| `?device=tablet` / `phone` / `desktop` | Use that device's layout |
| `?fit=screen` / `width` / `actual` | Fit the view on screen, fill the width, or actual size |
| `?kiosk` | Hide Home Assistant's header bar |
| `?view=Upstairs` | Open on this view (name or id) |
| `?return=5` | Go back to that view after 5 minutes without a touch |
| `?noedit` | Hide the edit pencil and the E shortcut |

e.g. `…/panalume?view=Upstairs&return=5&noedit&fit=screen&kiosk`

## Develop

```sh
cd panalume/app && npm install
HA_URL=http://<your-ha>:8123 HA_TOKEN_FILE=<file with a long-lived token> npm run server   # :8099
npm run dev                                                                                  # Vite on :5173
```

### Adding a card type

Drop a `.svelte` file into `panalume/app/src/cards/` that exports a `meta` object from `<script module>`:

```js
export const meta = {
  type: 'my-card', name: 'My card', icon: 'mdi:star', category: 'Info',
  size: { w: 240, h: 140 },
  fields: [{ key: 'entity', label: 'Entity', type: 'entity' }],   // builds the editor form
  sections: [{ key: 'graph', label: 'Graph' }],                     // optional show/hide chips
  autofill: () => ({ entity: find(/^sensor\.my_integration_/) }),   // optional auto-detection
};
```

Use `t()` / `ent()` from `lib/tpl.js` so every setting can be a template. Release by bumping `version` in `panalume/config.yaml` and adding a `CHANGELOG.md` entry.

*Screenshots and the demo video use a demo house with made-up entities.*
